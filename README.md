# Terrain-Rendering-Using-Mesh-Shading

Here is the work I've been doing during my research internship at INRIA Grenoble between January and June 2024, with Thibault Tricard as my supervisor.
You can already find my report to PDF format.
The base shader is made by Thibault Tricard using his own Vulkan library LavaCake. I will add the code with my contribution later on.
